    Micropost.where("user_id = ?", id)
    #equivalent to simply, 
    #microposts
    #Weâ€™ve used the code in Listing 10.39 instead 
    #because it generalizes much more naturally to the
    # full status feed needed in Chapter 11.
  end
=begin   NOTE about ABOVE:
The question mark in

Micropost.where("user_id = ?", id)

ensures that id is properly escaped before being 
included in the underlying SQL query, thereby avoiding
a serious security hole called SQL injection. The id
attribute here is just an integer, so there is no   danger in this case, but always escaping variables
injected into SQL statements is a good habit to 
cultivate.
